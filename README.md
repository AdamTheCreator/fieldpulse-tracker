You are likely already having high-impact conversations that map to our 5 Copilot Value Plays. You just might not be calling them that. 

Use this guide to translate your "business as usual" meetings into **Revenue Impact Logs**.

### 1. The Play: "Automate Simple Tasks"
**Official Definition:** Using Coding Agent/CLI to clear backlogs and boilerplate.
**🚨 TRIGGER: You are running this play if you hear yourself saying:**
* *"Let's just script that out quickly."*
* *"Why are your senior devs writing boilerplate?"*
* *"You shouldn't be spending a whole sprint on these minor bug fixes."*
* *"Let's use Copilot to clear out that backlog of 'toil' work."*
* *"We can automate that grunt work."*

### 2. The Play: "Accelerate Velocity and Quality"
**Official Definition:** Improving PR velocity and code review quality via Rulesets/Instructions.
**🚨 TRIGGER: You are running this play if you hear yourself saying:**
* *"Why is that PR sitting there for 3 days?"*
* *"Your senior devs are acting like spell-checkers in code review."*
* *"Let's setup a rule so Copilot reviews this before a human does."*
* *"We can catch these style errors automatically."*
* *"You're moving too slow because of review bottlenecks."*

### 3. The Play: "Improve Quality and Maintainability"
**Official Definition:** Increasing test coverage, refactoring, and reducing defects.
**🚨 TRIGGER: You are running this play if you hear yourself saying:**
* *"This code is brittle; everyone is afraid to touch it."*
* *"You have zero unit tests here? Let's generate some right now."*
* *"Let's refactor this messy function."*
* *"We need to stop shipping bugs to prod."*
* *"Let's clean up this legacy module."*

### 4. The Play: "Scale Institutional Knowledge"
**Official Definition:** Using Copilot Spaces/Knowledge to fix onboarding and silos.
**🚨 TRIGGER: You are running this play if you hear yourself saying:**
* *"How long does it take a new hire to merge their first PR?"* (If they say >1 month).
* *"Stop answering the same questions in Slack over and over."*
* *"Where is the documentation for this? Is it outdated?"*
* *"Let's put that context into a Copilot Space so the whole team has it."*
* *"Your senior devs are getting interrupted too much."*

### 5. The Play: "Burn Down Technical Debt"
**Official Definition:** Major modernization projects, dependency upgrades, legacy patterns.
**🚨 TRIGGER: You are running this play if you hear yourself saying:**
* *"We need to get off Java 8."*
* *"This migration is going to take a year unless we accelerate it."*
* *"You have 'fix me' comments from 2019 in here."*
* *"Let's prioritize a 'Tech Debt Sprint'."*
* *"We can upgrade these dependencies automatically."*
